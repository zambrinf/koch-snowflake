# Koch Snowflake Algorithm
This algorithm creates a N-dimensional dictionary in python with instructions to draw a N-iteration Koch Snowflake.

This was developed because in the internet all I could find was codes with a specif number of iterations, like 2,3 or 4
and I wanted to make a code for any number of iterations the user wants
